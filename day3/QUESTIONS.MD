# Questions ðŸ™‹
1. True or False: the Internet Computer has a unique public key that can be used to verify responses coming from any subnets.  
**True**  
  
2. True or False: when I realize an update call, the boundary node will participate in the consensus but not during query calls.  
**False. At any time, for an update call or for a simple query call, the bondary node participates by rooting the requests. They are intermediaries between the clients and the subnets, even if no consensus (query call) is necessary**  
  
3. True or False: I can create a certified variable that will certify the response of the following actor:  
**Yes (even if I didn't understand how to do it :D... need a lecture to learn !!). Source : https://gist.github.com/nomeata/f325fcd2a6692df06e38adedf9ca1877**
```
actor {
    public func hello(name : Text) : async Text {
        return ("hello # name");
    };
}
